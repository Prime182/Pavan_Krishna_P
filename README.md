📊 Data Visualization Intern
Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai (IMD)
May 2024 – Jun 2024

Analyzed 10 years of hourly Discomfort Index data (2013–2023) using Python and Tableau

Discovered strong positive correlation between temperature and DI, and varying correlation patterns with humidity

Built trend visualizations highlighting increasing discomfort levels in May–August seasons over years

Proposed forecasting models and public alert systems using SARIMAX and interactive dashboards

Key finding: Hourly granularity is crucial for precise DI trend analysis and public health alerting

💡 Projects
🔁 AI-Driven Business Process Automation
"Automating sentiment-driven engagement with zero human intervention"

Stack: Python, Transformers (Modern-BERT), PostgreSQL, n8n, Gemini API

Scraped leads via Apify, classified sentiments (positive/neutral/negative), stored them in a SQL DB

Triggered AI-personalized replies for each comment using Gemini + dynamic templates

Set up automated workflows in n8n with webhook-based engagement & campaign analytics

Accuracy: 94.82% on sentiment classifier

Tech Challenges: Token limit handling, real-time delay resolution, template embedding
